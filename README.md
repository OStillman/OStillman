Redevelopment of my Website (long overdue...)

Aim is to have a fully functioning website running on my Rapsberry Pi4. 

Will be also following TDD princicples as much as possible throughout development

## How have I found TDD?

The method I've used is poor, beyond testing code and simple HTML validation it starts to come up short. 

However, TDD has been useful for me to develop with confidence, and I think the resultant Python is tidier than if I was to attempt it all in one go, as I usually do. 

All in all, a good introduction to TDD that I'll be sure to carry on using in future projects!
